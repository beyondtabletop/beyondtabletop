      "title": "Big News: Beyond Tabletop now 100% free for all users",
      "body": "Starting today, Beyond Tabletop will offer its previously-Premium products **for free to all users**. If you have made a purchase in the last 30 days and would like a refund, please let me know on reddit PM or discord. Moving forward, instead of charging for products, I will be accepting donations via [PayPal](https://paypal.me/beyondtabletop). This change is for a lot of reasons, but essentially it’s because:\n\n- BTT doesn’t make enough money to be my full-time job, and that was never my goal. I don’t feel right charging for it if I’m not able to support it as much as I want as it grows.\n- The code footprint needed to support purchases is massive. By getting rid of it, I can streamline a lot of the codebase and focus my work hours on making the products better.\n- No payment processing and no emails means much less overhead. That means I can afford to host and run BTT on much smaller monthly earnings (in the neighborhood of 1/10 of the cost)\n- By making this a free product, I can eventually also open up the code base and make it open-source. I’ve been wrestling with the idea of opening up the code to players for a long time, but haven’t really been able to do it until now.\n\nThe new version of Beyond Tabletop is a completely rewritten codebase. For those of you interested, the previous BTT was running on a Rails/Redis/AngularJS/SQL/Firebase stack, which was becoming more and more cumbersome to update. The new site is pure Angular 7 and Firebase, which means code should be less buggy, and easier to find bugs in when they come up.\n\nBecause this is a totally new codebase, a few features didn't make the transfer. Most notably: Battlemap drawing. If this was your favorite feature in the world and you can't live without it, please let me know. It's really difficult to implement, but if there's enough interest I'm sure I could figure it out.\n\nLastly, of course, if you find any bugs or have any issues using the site normally, please let me know in the [discord](https://discord.gg/99xNTE7) or [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondtabletop). Thanks to everyone who's been a part of this community for all these years!",

You can change your map type by clicking the gear icon and selecting in the list of Scenes. You can also add new scenes to switch between the different map types to see how they work differently.\n\nLastly, 4.1.0 also adds freehand drawing to shapes! Create a shape, then select it and check \"Drawing\" in the left panel. You should see 3 new icons appear next to the shape. The paintbrush icon toggles draw mode on and off, the second icon lets you choose a color, and the third icon clears all lines from the shape. \n\nWith draw mode on you can scribble freehand drawings of buildings or scenery to give your players a sense of what's going on in a battle without preparing a whole ton beforehand.

If for some reason the above link directs you to the dashboard instead of the migration page, then congratulations! Your account has already been migrated.\n\nIf you don’t feel like migrating now, you have 6 more weeks to do it before your Google Drive files will no longer be accessible. If you still haven’t migrated in the week before I flip the big switch, I’ll send you another email to remind you. And of course, if you run into any errors or issues during the migration process, please feel free to let us know on the subreddit.

Because of this, we are transitioning to Firebase, a new realtime database that keeps all your tools in one place.\n\nLong story short, if you would like to retain the tools you've created, you'll need to log into your Beyond Tabletop account to migrate your data into the new database. I would do it for you, but because your tools are stored on YOUR Google Drive, I don't have access to it when you're not logged in. Sorry!\n\nFortunately the process is fairly painless, simply visit the migration page (which is linked from the dashboard announcement) and click the button. The process takes up to a few minutes, and once it's done, your experience on Beyond Tabletop will use the new Firebase database exclusively. If for some reason the above link directs you to the dashboard instead of the migration page, then congratulations! Your account has already been migrated.\n\nYou will have the opportunity to migrate for the next few months. We'll also send another email to everyone who hasn't migrated (and hasn't unsubscribed) when we're getting ready to move the entire system over. But once we close the migration, all your Google Drive Beyond Tabletop files will no longer be accessible.\n\nUnrelated note: it's probably also worth mentioning that we now accept cryptocurrencies via Coinbase on our payment page. So if you've been eyeing that $10 upgrade, but didn't want BIG BROTHER tracking your online role-playing platform spending habits, you're in luck.\n\nNow more than ever we want to hear your feedback. If your migration doesn't work, or Firebase is acting up, or you've discovered some other bug, let us know! We stay active on new threads and address any problem that comes up. We'd also like to hear what you think of the new system, if it behaves similarly to Google Drive, etc. Alright, that's it for now. ",

      "body": "A few months ago I shared the news that Google’s Realtime API, which was core to the functionality of Beyond Tabletop, was being discontinued. The API was a free data service that allowed us to provide RPG tools for very little cost to our players by using the Google Drive of individual users as a distributed database. With the announcement that this service was being discontinued, I didn’t see a realistic way to continue to offer our product to our users, so I posted messages on the subreddit, dashboard, and upgrade pages to warn existing and potential customers.\n\nSince then I have been working to try to find a way to revive Beyond Tabletop utilizing other services. I am happy to announce that I have found a way forward, and that for the time being, nothing will change for the player’s experience using Beyond Tabletop’s tools. I expect Beyond Tabletop to continue to function after the Realtime API is discontinued, and that we will continue to be able to support your characters and games. \n\nI am currently developing Beyond Tabletop integration with another Google realtime database: Firebase. The main difference between the previous database and this one is Firebase does not use Google Drive. So instead of storing sheets on your individual Google Drive accounts, Firebase stores all the data in a centralized database.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. While I am optimistic about the opportunity presented by Firebase, there is a lot of uncertainty still about what a finished product may look like. Additionally, this may cause me to reassess how I introduce products or operate the business in the future, because Beyond Tabletop will now be assuming the cost of maintaining the database. But for now, the security of Firebase gives Beyond Tabletop a much longer runway than the one-year death-sentence I posted about before. \n\nAs you use Beyond Tabletop in the next few months, I will automatically sync your data from Google Drive to the new Firebase. This will help give me a sense of scale for the database so I can more confidently move forward. This should not affect your play experience.\n\nThat’s about all I know for right now. I will post updates as I continue to develop the new iteration of the tools, but I am hopeful that Beyond Tabletop will continue to provide you with the RPG tools you need into the future. As the updates roll out, please let me know in the subreddit if you experience bugs or interruptions when using the tools. Thanks to everyone who has supported this project over the last few years!",

      "body": "EDIT: Beyond Tabletop has risen like a Lich King. Read more here: <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+Beyondtabletop/posts/PD15UZN9Uzz\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://plus.google.com/+Beyondtabletop/posts/PD15UZN9Uzz</a>\n\nOriginal post below:\n\nIt is with a lot of sadness that I have to share the news that Beyond Tabletop will be forced to shut down in December 2018. On November 28, 2017, Google announced that it had deprecated (stopped supporting) the Google Realtime API. The Realtime API was the core of Beyond Tabletop’s codebase, and without it Beyond Tabletop will not be able to function in its current form. The Realtime API will remain in service for one year, until December 11, 2018. On that date the Beyond Tabletop website will be taken offline.\n\nNot only do our tools rely on the Realtime API, but our business model does as well. The Realtime API was incredibly cheap and cost-effective for what it delivered, allowing us to provide access to tools at an incredibly low, one-time cost. If we switch to a different platform (such as Firestore) the costs would require us to switch to a subscription model. While it’s possible we may find a way to pivot in that direction, it is unlikely, and the product we’d deliver for a subscription would significantly differ from our current tools. Since we’re not comfortable now promising a full re-design and re-build of the site, we have decided to let this project run its course.\n\nBeyond Tabletop has been a passion project for me for a long time. The product has grown as I have grown as a developer. I couldn’t have done it without this amazing community who have been so helpful and patient over the years. Thanks especially to all you who supported me and bought upgrades.\n\nSo that’s it. I’ll work on creating a good way to export or print sheet and campaign data in the coming months. If anything changes between now and December 2018, I’ll be sure to let everyone know. Thanks again!\n\nTrevor<br />Beyond Tabletop Dev<br />",

The good news is that you can now use advanced calculations, like multiplication, division, and mod (and parentheses) in your conditions.

The first condition checked is the first one that will apply. When unchecking, the system recalculates all remaining effects from top down (first to last).\n- Some stats for condition effects only accept a single numerical value instead of a formula. These are typically for adjusting combat stats like \"Ranged Attack\" or \"Melee Damage.\"\n\nPlease let me know on the subreddit if you run into any bugs.

Here's the changelog, I'll go into some more depth about the details in my next few posts.\n\n- Added new Powers tab which contains information and settings specific to your class(es). Too much stuff here to list it all, but many of the new items will affect other parts of the character sheet so double check all your stats before your next play session.\n- Added new Powers overview block, which includes fields to quickly adjust values you may need during an encounter or play session.\n- Added a new Rest block for buttons that trigger short and long rests, each of which reset a number of class specific features. The block also includes a field and a button for rolling hit dice, which will heal you when you click it.\n- Added a Wounds field in the vitals overview block for quickly adjusting health during a battle.\n- Added hit dice total and remaining to vitals block\n- Fixed an issue on the Table where you couldn’t remove a tool that had been deleted from Drive.\n- Added new Nickname field on the Table. Now your chat messages and the player list will show your nickname instead of the name you give Google.\n- Table chat can now be minimized! Look for the small caret icon near the top right of the screen, to the left of chat.\n- Changed the way armor bonus is calculated. For all armor, 10 points will NO LONGER automatically be added to the total AC bonus. Instead, enter the total AC bonus into the new “AC” field (previously “Bonus”). For Monks who have the benefit of Unarmored Movement, your AC, including the base of 10, will still automatically be calculated and applied.\n- Added support for Magic and Other types of armor. Previous version didn’t calculate those AC bonuses properly\n- Colored dice icons!!!!! This update was crazy I had to add something whimsical to stay sane.\n- On the General Tab, background attributes, including specialties, are now selectable via select dropdown instead of radio buttons\n- Brand new homepage image, illustrated by Tim Giusti!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.beyondtabletop.com\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.beyondtabletop.com</a>",

      "title": "Beyond Tabletop Introduces Online Support, Dice Rolling, and More! (2.0.0 Update)",
      "body": "We’re excited to bring you the biggest update (so far) to Beyond Tabletop - online support! As you know, the early versions of Beyond Tabletop were designed for in-person play, but we’ve been working for the last 8 months to enable groups that have remote players to also take advantage of our full set of tools. But this update is more than just online support - we also introduce a new tool (the Table), dice rolling, group chat, cross-tool communication, D&D Next sheet improvements, and many application performance enhancements. \n\nFirst, I want to introduce Tables. Think of this new tool like the online version of a real gaming table - this is where the action happens. Your character sheets, your dice rolls, your online chat and more can all interact with the Table, keeping all your tools and players organized and in one place.\n\nYou make a Table just like you’d make a character sheet or battlemap, and then add your sheets and maps to it - these become tabs on the Table that are easy to switch between. Share the Table and your tools with your friends and players - they can see all the available tools and request access to any they don’t have permission to open. \n\nTables allow for cross-tool communication. Your players can add their own sheets or maps to your table, and actions they (or you) take on a character sheet show in the table’s chat. Since we’re also adding dice rolling to character sheets in this update, this means no more suspiciously consistent crits from that one person in your party (you know who you are).\n\nWe’re also improving the D&D Next character sheet and are planning more improvements in future releases. In this update, you can now select your class, level and background, along with the background’s personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws from drop down select options, rather than typing them all out yourself. This also means we can auto-calculate a few small things like skill proficiencies based on your background, and ability proficiencies based on your class. You can also keep track of hit dice.\n\nLastly, in this update we’ve completely changed the way the tools are loaded. You should notice that navigating between tools is snappier and the app in general is much faster. The new architecture of the system has a number of advantages, including better accessibility and file administration from the dashboard. It also opens up the possibility of porting Beyond Tabletop to more devices’ native apps - something we’re investigating now.\n\nWe’re very excited to finally get this in your hands, and we want to know what you think! Let us know how you like the update, or how you use Beyond Tabletop for your home game on our forums.\n\nChangelog for v2.0.0\n\n- Introducing the new Table tool. Tables are used to organize tools and players all in one place with real-time chat.\n- Tables list tools and include an easy button for players to request access to any tool they cannot open.\n- Added Dice tab on both sheets. Useful stats can now be rolled with a click of a button.\n- Added cross-tool communication. If you open a sheet on a table, your dice rolls will be sent to the chat\n- Brand new app routing for all tools, allowing for faster tool switching and faster load times.\n- Added file administration on dashboard, including deleting and copying files.\n- Added Backgrounds to D&D Next sheets\n- Added Class and Level select to D&D Next sheets\n- Added hit dice tracking to D&D Next sheets\n- Fixed a long-standing bug where you couldn’t use anything other than the primary google account you were logged in as. Now you can use any account to login and use tools!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.beyondtabletop.com\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.beyondtabletop.com</a>",

There are over 8,000 people using our tools, with more and more signing up every day. Since we launched we’ve tweaked and added features to make the experience of playing RPGs online better and more fun.\n\nWe've also had a lot of great discussion in our support and suggestion forums—you guys really are awesome! Posters are great at pointing out where the tools could use work and the feedback has been very positive. We couldn’t be happier to be working on it.\n\nThat’s why we’re really excited to announce a few things:\n\nFirstly, we’re going to be updating this blog with a change list every time we push an update to Beyond Tabletop. We’ll also be posting a little bit about the decisions that go into making Beyond Tabletop’s tools.\n\nSecondly, we have a big update coming soon, which we hope will expand the number of people who can use Beyond Tabletop. When we launched, we focused on the experience of the in-person gaming group. We wanted to create tools that were easy for a real life group to use. This update will finally extend support to online groups as well. Among many many other features, we’re adding a “Table” tool which will allow groups to organize and provide a central location to load all your sheets and maps. We’ll post about it more detail when we are ready to release it.\n\nLastly, as you’ll see in our next post, the battlemap is getting zoom functionality! Now you can zoom in and out of your battle so it is easier to orient yourself and find the action. As always, let us know how you like this new feature and if there’s anything we can do to improve it.\n\nGame on, <br />Beyond Tabletop Dev Team",

Our web application is subscription-free and designed to be used on all devices. We currently offer two products - a battle map, which is designed to accommodate many RPG systems, and character sheets, which are built for the Pathfinder system (with more systems on the way!)\n\nOur app connects to your Google account, so your character sheets, maps and other Beyond Tabletop files are stored on your own Google Drive. Using Drive means you get nearly infinite storage space for your files. Pay for access to each tool once; you keep your files forever. You can also share any of your files with other users as easily as you can share any other Drive file.\n\nTake our tools for a test drive and let us know what you think!",

I’m not a Mathmagician, but I’m pretty sure we aren’t going to make it.\n\nIt’s not all bad news though! We are still committed to developing Beyond Tabletop and providing you with a great product for your game nights. Over the next few months, our focus will be on delivering the best possible experience for the in-person gaming session.\n\nFirst, we’re going to scale back our hosting solution, allowing us to get rid of subscriptions and Player, GM, and Party packages. Instead, we’ll be offering the full application at a one-time cost of $10.\n\nSecond, we’re going to really work to enhance the functionality, usability, and accessibility of the application for real-life play. Based on the feedback we’ve received, we’ll be focusing on making this the best application it can be on touch devices like tablets and touch phones.\n\nSo we hope you’ll stick with us and continue to help us make Beyond Tabletop better. If you haven’t done so already, please go to <a href=\"http://www.beyondtabletop.com\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.beyondtabletop.com</a> and sign up for our updates. In about a month, we’ll start offering those $10 accounts to the people who have signed up on our website.\n\nWe’re very excited to continue to work on this project. We also want to thank everyone who supported us, asked questions and had ideas to help us adapt in the last several weeks. Beyond Tabletop has grown into a much better product because of your contributions. Thank you, and happy gaming!",

      "body": "We're only two weeks away until the end of our Kickstarter campaign, but we still have a long way to go. We're redoubling our efforts in the next two weeks to get the word out about Beyond Tabletop, and we hope you will do the same.\n\nMore importantly, we are hard at work polishing our application for our alpha users! This morning we finished a new update which fully integrates character sheets with the tabletop. Now you make your changes and preview them on the character sheet viewer, then join any table and bring your character into the same window without having to switch between browser tabs! Adding a character to the table also adds a personalized token, which you can also set up on the character sheet page.\n\nFinally, we have included a list of upcoming features on our Kickstarter page. These are features we plan to implement, and our early users will help us determine which ones are more important to create first. The features include Offline Mode, hexagonal maps, background image support, and native apps for Android, iOS and Windows 8.\n\nOnce again, we want to thank our friends, family, and backers for supporting us and this product we have created. Continue to tell your friends or anyone who may be interested in playing tabletop RPGs on their phone, tablet or computer!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beyondtabletop/beyond-tabletop/\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beyondtabletop/beyond-tabletop/</a>",

      "body": "Based on user feedback so far we’ve decided to make a change to our pricing that we think users will really like. We’re getting rid of subscriptions for Player accounts. We are gamers and we know gamers don’t like subscriptions. By moving Player accounts to a one-time fee, we think more people will be able to enjoy our application, and will get a better experience out of it.\n\nGame Master accounts will remain subscription-based mainly because Game Masters will be hosting games and have campaign assets, which cost more money to maintain than Player accounts. We feel like this new pricing better reflects the needs of gamers; you can play the game without paying too much, and we can still afford to keep the servers running and continue developing this application. We are also keeping our party packages so that game masters can save money when buying for a group of players.\n\nWe also want to take this opportunity to thank all the people who have supported us so far and given us some really great feedback. We will continue to make our product great with your support.",

      "body": "Our Kickstarter project has been up for a few days now--enough time to collect some data and analyze our viewers' behaviors. We've already raised over 5% of our total goal, which is awesome progress! We did notice though, for the amount of visitors who watched our video, only about 25% of them got to the end. Of those visitors who started the video, only 1% actually backed the project.\n\nWe have also gotten some feedback from friends and message boards that our application's features aren't talked about enough on our Kickstarter page. People know we're offering in a vague way, but they don't specifically see how powerful and easy Beyond Tabletop's tools are to use.\n\nBecause of all this, we've put together a new video for our Kickstarter page that's just over 2 minutes instead of 4:30. The video focuses on actually using Beyond Tabletop, instead of talking about it! We hope that will a new round of promotion, we'll be able to double, maybe even quadruple our conversion rate.\n\nThanks to everyone who's supported our project so far, and also thanks to everyone who has given us feedback. It really helps!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beyondtabletop/beyond-tabletop\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beyondtabletop/beyond-tabletop</a>\n\nKeep telling your friends or anyone you know who may be interesting in shedding the woes of pencil and paper from their tabletop RPGs!",

      "body": "One of the things our friends and early testers kept asking for was the ability to create separate groups within the Stats section of their character sheets. We originally didn't have groups, because different RPG systems split their stats up in different ways, and we wanted to keep it flexible. But when our users ask, we deliver. Today I have been working on setting up stat grouping. Here's how it works:\n\nEach stat keeps track of its group. If a stat has no group, it defaults to the \"stats\" group. Users can set the name of the group manually via a text field on the Edit screen. In the future, we'll be setting up some slick UI so you can drag and drop stats from one group to another, but for now you can just use the text field. When you enter a new name into the group field, the application adds a navigation tab at the top of your character sheet. Now you can split up your stats between groups, keeping as many stats as necessary on screen at any time.\n\nThese features are part of the Beyond Tabletop character sheet builder, which you can get access to if you back our kickstarter:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beyondtabletop/beyond-tabletop\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beyondtabletop/beyond-tabletop</a>\n\nOnce our project is funded, all backers who signed up for Alpha Phase access will receive their accounts and get access to all our tools!",

If we meet our goal, Alpha accounts will be sent out over the course of that week.<br />June 1 - Alpha Phase ends, Closed Beta Phase begins. Everyone who signed up at the yearly pricing will get access to the Closed Beta<br />July 1 - Closed Beta Phased ends and Open Beta Phase begins.\n\nThose dates will be fluid. We may not need a whole month for each phase, or we may need more time. After we move into Open Beta, we'll start preparing for the \"official\" release later in the year. If we meet our mobile app stretch goals, we'll release the Android and iOS apps at that time too.\n\nDon't forget to connect with us on twitter, facebook or whatever else!\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/beyondtabletop\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://twitter.com/beyondtabletop</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beyond-Tabletop/221970904611220\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beyond-Tabletop/221970904611220</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/beyondtabletop\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://www.youtube.com/user/beyondtabletop</a><br /><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/1/b/115673272174710929091/115673272174710929091/posts\" class=\"ot-anchor\">https://plus.google.com/u/1/b/115673272174710929091/115673272174710929091/posts</a>",
